# CarService Project 🚗

This is a basic web application built using **Spring MVC** and **JSP** to manage car services. It demonstrates key concepts like MVC architecture, form handling, and basic service registration functionality. The project also uses a **YAML (.yml)** configuration file for setting up application properties.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java**: Backend logic
- **Spring MVC**: To implement the Model-View-Controller design pattern
- **JSP (JavaServer Pages)**: For rendering the user interface
- **Spring Beans**: Dependency injection and bean management
- **YAML (.yml)**: Configuration for application properties (like database settings, server configurations, etc.)
- **Maven**: For dependency management and project structure
- **Tomcat**: As the web server

### 📂 Project Structure

The project follows the standard MVC architecture:

- **Model**: Represents car service data (like car details, service types, etc.).
- **View (JSP)**: Renders the data on the client side.
- **Controller**: Manages the interaction between the user and the model (handling HTTP requests, form submissions, and routing).
- **application.yml**: Used for externalizing configuration settings, such as database connections and server properties.

### 💡 Features

- **Service Registration**: Users can register for a car service by providing necessary details like car model, service type, and personal information.
- **View Registered Services**: Lists all the services registered by users.

### 📝 Future Improvements

- Add validation for form inputs.
- Implement user authentication for service registration.
- Enhance the UI with better styling using CSS or integrate with a frontend framework.
